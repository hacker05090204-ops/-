# GOVERNANCE RECOVERY ROOT DECLARATION

**Date:** 2026-01-17
**Authority:** Chief Governance Architect / System Recovery Lead
**Incident ID:** GOV-REC-2026-001

## ⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER
**THIS SYSTEM HAS UNDERGONE A CRITICAL GOVERNANCE LOSS EVENT.**
The documentation contained within this recovery structure is **RECONSTRUCTED**.
Unless explicitly linked to an original, cryptographically verified freeze file, all governance records should be treated as **POST-LOSS RECONSTRUCTION** intended to restore auditability, not as original historical artifacts.

## 1. Incident Summary
A verified system audit performed on 2026-01-17 confirmed the physical loss of directory structures and governance documentation for multiple system phases. While executable code for later phases (15+) remains largely intact, the foundational governance chain (Phases 1-14) and specific intermediate phases (18, 25) are missing.

**Recovery Strategy:** Three-Track Recovery (Governance Reconstruction, Code Stabilization, Test Restoration).

## 2. Affected Scope (Loss Inventory)

### PHYSICALLY MISSING (Governance-Only Reconstruction)
The following phases are absent from the filesystem. They will be reconstructed as "Governance-Only" shells to preserve the logical dependency chain.
- Phase 01: Foundation
- Phase 02: Core Types
- Phase 03: Security Primitives
- Phase 04: Governance Engine
- Phase 05: Policy Layer
- Phase 06: Audit Logging
- Phase 07: Identity
- Phase 08: Access Control
- Phase 09: Data Safety
- Phase 10: Network Security
- Phase 11: Encryption
- Phase 12: Storage
- Phase 13: Integrity (Freeze file exists)
- Phase 14: Resilience (Freeze file exists)
- Phase 18: Unknown/Lost (Freeze file exists)
- Phase 25: Unknown/Lost (Freeze file exists)

### UNGOVERNED CODE (Re-anchoring Required)
The following phases exist as code but lack internal governance documentation. They will be re-anchored with new governance records acknowledging their "orphan" status.
- Phase 15: Enforcement
- Phase 16: UI
- Phase 17: Runtime
- Phase 19: Submission
- Phase 20: Reflection
- Phase 21: Patch Covenant
- Phase 22: Chain of Custody
- Phase 23: Regulatory Export
- Phase 24: Final Seal
- Phase 26: UI (Modern)
- Phase 27: External Assurance
- Phase 28: Disclosure
- Phase 29: API

## 3. Recovery Authorization
**I, acting as the System Recovery Lead, explicitly authorize the reconstruction of this governance chain.**
This action is taken to:
1.  Restore the legal defensibility of the existing code.
2.  Provide a stable foundation for future development (Phase 30+).
3.  Transparency regarding the loss event.

**Signed:**
*System Recovery Lead*
