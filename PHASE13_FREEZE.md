**STATUS: FROZEN / READ-ONLY**
**DATE: 2026-01-13 (Restored)**

## Scope
This phase defines the core safety and governance constraints for the Kali MCP Toolkit.
It ensures that all subsequent phases strictly adhere to the "No Autonomy, No Learning, No Scoring" invariants.

## Integrity Hash
FAIL-SAFE-001: All actions must be auditable.
FAIL-SAFE-002: No autonomous decision loops.
FAIL-SAFE-003: User must approve all state changes.

## Verification
This file must remain immutable unless a full chain-of-custody reset occurs.
