Phase-5 Scanner Tests

All tests use synthetic artifacts (no real Phase-4 data).
Tests validate:
- Data model correctness
- Architectural boundary enforcement
- Immutability guarantees
- Graceful degradation

Run with:
    PYTHONPATH=kali-mcp-toolkit/python python -m pytest kali-mcp-toolkit/python/artifact_scanner/tests/ -v
